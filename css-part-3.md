<h1>Adding Navigation Buttons to Pages</h1>
<p>Adding navigation elements to your pages is an easy way with which you can direct your audience to specific units of content within your site. For example, after providing some input material such as a vocabulary exercise, you might suggest your user follows a link to a page of further practice or information.</p>

<p>This short tutorial provides an example, to help illustrate the point.</p>
<p>To begin, I have created a short dialog cards exercise for students to learn some basic Polish phrases.</p>
