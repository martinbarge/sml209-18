<h1>Adding Navigation Buttons to Pages</h1>
<p>Adding navigation elements to your pages is an easy way with which you can direct your audience to specific units of content within your site. For example, after providing some input material such as a vocabulary exercise, you might suggest your user follows a link to a page of further practice or information.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>This short tutorial provides an example, to help illustrate the point.</p>
<p>To begin, I have created a short dialog cards exercise for students to learn some basic Polish phrases.</p>

<p>If you have time, you can practise your pronunciation on the next page:</p>
<a style="float:right;" href="exercises.html" class="btn2">Additional Exercises</a>
<p style="clear:both;"></p>

<h2>How to do this</h2>
<p>First you need to be sure you have a hidden page to link to. So create a page in your GitHub repository, but don't add it to the top navigation.</p>
<p>Next, follow the instructions on this slide tutorial to insert the links and style them as buttons.</p>

<p>That's it. It's quite simple, but useful.</p>
