<h1>Creating Multimedia Materials.</h1>
<h2>Creating Screen Casts</h2> 
<p>One way in which you can engage your learners in language learning activity is by presenting language in a multimedia format. There are a number of advantages to presenting language items in this way. For instance, the learner not only sees the language, but also hears the pronunciation of the language at the same time. In addition to this, visual illustrations can be used to show the learner what the language means.</p>

<p>Brett (1997) makes the point that "multimedia applications allow the traditional language learning tools of audio, video, texts and feedback to the learner to be located in one place, the computer screen" (Brett, 1997, 34).
Here are three video clips that I have made as examples for this course.</p>

<h2>Example 1: Screencasting a Map Tour</h2>

<h1>How to make screencasts</h1>
<p>The above examples are rather basic, and they are merely designed to illustrate this technique for presenting new language using multimedia. They are also designed to show you how easy it is to make such materials using freely available tools. The tools I used to create the videos above are:</p>
<p>1. Slides: Google Slides: <a href="https://www.google.com/slides/about/">https://www.google.com/slides/about/</a></p>
<p>2. Images: Creative Commons Search: <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/">https://search.creativecommons.org/</a></p>
<p>3. Google Maps: <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps">https://www.google.co.uk/maps</a></p>
<p>4. Screen recording: <a href="http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/">http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/</a></p>
<p>Note: The easiest way to deliver your video on the web is to upload it to YouTube, Vimeo, Screencast-O-Matic, Google Drive, or other video-sharing website that allows you to embed your video into your web page.</p>
<p><strong>Other ideas</strong></p>
<p>With a little bit of imagination, you can quickly and easily make multimedia materials for your target audience. You can, for example, create narrative voice-overs of moving images or descriptions of complex scenes. You can also use screencasts to create video-based demonstrations and tutorials, as well as readings of poetry.</p>
